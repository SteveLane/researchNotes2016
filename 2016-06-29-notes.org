** Notes
*** Estimating intervals after expert elicitation    :elicitation:confidence:
  <2016-06-29 Wed 11:17>
  - A simple clipped average is seen to be perform well (Lyon, Wintle and Burgman, 2015)
  - But what about some other way of aggregation?
  - What about minimising difference from implied distributions to the /target/
    - e.g. by Kullback-Leibler divergence
