*** Intro

- paper selected for the QAECO reading group
- stochastic geometry of biodiversity
  - what does this mean?
- little fanfare due to sociological tendencies

*** Review of unified theories

- focus on theories that /reproduce/ patterns of macroecology
  - specifically, species-area relationships and local species abundance

*** Different mathematical languages

- different spatial areas
- continuum and MaxEnt models seem as though they would approach the point process models as $A \rightarrow 0$
- bit pretentious with the pseudo-Latin (!)
- surely the suggestion of a stochastic geometry fits in with disease context?

*** Minimally sufficient rules for the stochastic geometry of biodiversity

- rule 3: individuals between species can be treated as independent and placed without regard to other species
  - without having the applied background, how does this work?
  - competition, predation etc.
- The null 'rules' seem bogus
  - they're so obviously incorrect, that any improvement should be easy to accept?
- surely the strong interactions could be modelled?
