* Notes
** Trying to reorganise agenda files 
 <2016-08-26 Fri 12:31>
 - my agenda files started clogging up my init.el
 - if you set ~org-agenda-files~ to a filename, it'll use that file to store the list of files used for the agenda
 - upshot is, it works a charm
   - make sure though, that if you're copying over your previous ~org-agenda-files~ list, you don't put the filenames in quotes

 - I use [[https://github.com/joaotavora/yasnippet][Yasnippet]] for templating in emacs, but I was getting stupid templates for some modes
 - Yasnippet sets up default templates which are used by default (surprise, surprise!)
 - [[http://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/18800/disable-default-yasnippet-snippets][this emacs stackexchange]] shows how to turn off the defaults
